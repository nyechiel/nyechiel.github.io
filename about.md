This blog is written and maintained by Nir Yechiel. It started as a way to document thoughts on computer networking, but has grown to cover broader topics including product engineering and technology. The site is developed with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. Looking for slides from a talk I gave? Check [here](https://github.com/nyechiel/presentation-slides).
