Check out this blog post I wrote for Red Hat Stack on [SR-IOV networking support introduced in RHEL OpenStack Platfrom 6](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-enterprise-linux-openstack-platform-6-sr-iov-networking-part-i-understanding-basics). This is based on the Nova and Neutron work done at the upstream community for the OpenStack Juno release.
