Red Hat Summit is one of my favorite events of the year. It brings together customers, partners, community members and Red Hatters to talk about the open source innovations that are enabling the future of enterprise technology. Seeing the number of attendees growing year after year is also impressive and reassuring, as more and more folks are showing interest in Red Hat and its growing portfolio of products.

This year, due to the evolving coronavirus (COVID-19) developments, we decided to rebuild Red Hat Summit 2020 as a virtual event and cancel the physical event that was planned to be hosted in San Francisco. The date does not change - and the virtual event is going to happen on April 28-29.

The Red Hat Summit team is doing an INCREDIBLE job recreating the same content you would expect, with keynotes, breakout sessions, access to Red Hat experts, and even "booth" areas. In addition, all recorded content will be available for up to one year after the event. And the cherry on top, [access and registration](https://reg.summit.redhat.com/account/login?signin=19076843019aeedb970452cd57aac578) is free of charge and the event is [designed for a global audience across three main time-zones](https://www.redhat.com/en/summit/agenda/agenda-at-a-glance): North America and Latin America (NA + LATAM); Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia and the Pacific Rim (APAC).

Similar to a [post I did back in 2016](https://thenetworkway.wordpress.com/2016/07/07/networking-sessions-in-red-hat-summit-2016/), I would like to highlight key networking related sessions that are planned this time. Just click the links for more information:
