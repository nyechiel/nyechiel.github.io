Goodbye The Network Way, welcome [nyechiel.com](https://nyechiel.com/)!

When I started my blog a few years back I made the decision to use WordPress.com. While WordPress provides a powerful set of tools for creating and maintaining a blog and hides many of the complexities associated with running a website, I felt like I needed more control at this time and that I prefer to maintain my site myself. My goal was to make things as clean, minimalist and simple as possible. I really just need a way to keep my posts organized and accessible, and I donâ€™t see a need in many of the advanced features that WordPress offers.

After looking at some of the alternatives I decided upon using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host my blog, and use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator which has built-in support for GitHub Pages. My new site is now available at nyechiel.com, which you obviously know if you read this post. I migrated all of the content and old posts from the WordPress site into this new blog, and I decided to completely delete my WordPress site and account. 

The source code for this website is open and can be found [here](https://github.com/nyechiel/nyechiel.github.io). Feel free to take a look if you want to learn how I use Jekyll and what customization I made to make the site works for me. 

Happy blogging, and of course stay safe!
