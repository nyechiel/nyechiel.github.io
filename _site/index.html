But with May being Mental Health Awareness month, and with many of us spending most of our days at home amid the spread of COVID-19, I’ve been thinking a lot about mental health recently. I wanted to put together some of my thoughts, even if somewhat random, here.</p>

It brings together customers, partners, community members and Red Hatters to talk about the open source innovations that are enabling the future of enterprise technology. Seeing the number of attendees growing year after year is also impressive and reassuring, as more and more folks are showing interest in Red Hat and its growing portfolio of products.</p>

          </a>
        </h3><p>I recently attended the Red Hat Summit 2016 event that took place at San Francisco, CA, on June 27-30. Red Hat Summit is a great place to interact with customers, partners, and product leads, and learn about Red Hat and the company’s direction. While Red Hat is still mostly known for its Enterprise Linux (RHEL) business, it also offers products and solutions in the cloud computing, virtualization, middleware, storage, and systems management spaces. And networking is really a key piece in all of these.</p>

One of the first things I noticed after bringing up the setup is that although I have got L3 connectivity between the emulated Cumulus switches, I can’t get <a href="http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1ab.html">LLDP</a> to operate properly between the devices.</p>

        </h3><p><a href="https://cumulusnetworks.com/">Cumulus Linux</a> is a network operating system based on Debian that runs on top of industry standard <a href="https://cumulusnetworks.com/support/linux-hardware-compatibility-list/">networking hardware</a>. By providing a software-only solution, Cumulus is enabling disaggregation of data center switches similar to the x86 server hardware/software disaggregation. In addition to the networking features you would expect from a network operating system like L2 bridging, Spanning Tree Protocol, LLDP, bonding/LAG, L3 routing, and so on, it enables users to take advantage of the latest Linux applications and automation tools, which is in my opinion its true power.</p>

        </h3><p>In the <a href="/2015/12/28/reflections-on-the-networking-industry-part-1/">previous post</a> I briefly described the fact that many networks today are closed and vertically designed. While standard protocols are being adopted by vendors, true interoperability is still a challenge. Sure, you can bring up a BGP peer between platforms from different vendors and exchange route information (otherwise we couldn’t scale the Internet), but management and configuration is still, in most cases, vendor specific.</p>

            IPv6 Prefix Delegation - what is it and how does it going to help OpenStack?
          </a>
        </h3><p>IPv6 offers several ways to assign IP addresses to end hosts. Some of them (SLAAC, stateful DHCPv6, stateless DHCPv6) were already covered in <a href="/2014/07/02/ipv6-address-assignment-stateless-stateful-dhcp-oh-my/">this post</a>. The IPv6 Prefix Delegation mechanism (described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3769">RFC 3769</a> and <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3633.txt">RFC 3633</a>) provides “a way of automatically configuring IPv6 prefixes and addresses on routers and hosts” - which sounds like yet another IP assignment option. How does it differ from the other methods? And why do we need it? Let’s try to figure it out.</p>

          </a>
        </h3><p>The concept of Link Aggregation (LAG) is well known in the networking industry by now, and people usually consider it as a basic functionality that just works out of the box. With all of the SDN hype that’s going on out there, I sometimes feel that we tend to neglect some of the more “traditional” stuff like this one. As with many networking technologies and protocols, things may not just work out of the box, and it’s important to master the details to be able to design things properly, know what to expect to (i.e., what the normal behavior is) and ultimately being able to troubleshoot in case of a problem.</p>

          </a>
        </h3><p>People don’t like changes. IPv6 could have help to solve a lot of the burden in networks deployed today, which are still mostly based on the original version of the Internet Protocol, aka version 4. But time has come, and even the old tricks like throwing network address translation (NAT) everywhere are not going to help anymore, simply because we are out of IP addresses. It may take some more time, and people will do everything they can to (continue and) delay it, but believe me – there is no other way around – IPv6 is here to replace IPv4. IPv6 is also a critical part of the promise of the cloud and the Internet of Things (IoT). If you want to connect everything to the network, you better plan for massive scale and have enough addresses to use.</p>

        </h3><p>The IT industry has gained significant efficiency and flexibility as a direct result of virtualization. Organizations are moving toward a virtual datacenter model, and flexibility, speed, scale and automation are central to their success. While compute, memory resources and operating systems were successfully virtualized in the last decade, primarily due to the x86 server architecture, networks and network services have not kept pace.</p>
